### About me

<p align="justify">I am currently studying at the <b>Universade Católica de Brasília (UCB)</b> <i><a href="https://ucb.catolica.edu.br/portal/">[Catholic University of Brasilia]</a></i> and studying <b><i>Systems Analysis and Development</i></b>. I have always been very ambitious with regard to everything that involves technology, I like programming, to understand hardware and software of the different devices on the market, the impacts that result in the performance of the devices, to have mastery over the technology that is available. I am very interested in subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, IOT, Data Science, and areas that generate visible and perceptible results with ease, practicality. Even without having enough knowledge in the field, I have already ventured into making adjustments to LUA programming codes for a game that I tried to recreate as a hobby project, I have also ventured into using creativity to try to create a modified version of Super Mario World by pure fun!</p>
