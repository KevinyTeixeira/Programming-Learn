### What is It?

<p align="justify">The <b>Object-Oriented JAVA Programming Language</b> is used to develop from departmental applications to large corporate applications, in addition to mobile and local applications.</p>

### The main characteristics of this language are:
- Based on the object-oriented paradigm;
- Platform or multiplatform portability (write once, run anywhere);
- Extensive libraries of TCP / IP communication and interaction with protocols such as HTTP and FTP;
- Syntax similar to C, C and C #;
- High level of parallel and distributed programming;
- Automatic memory deallocation;

### The Java Technology:
Java is subdivided into three major parts, with regard to applicability. Are they:
- **Java Standard Edition (JSE):** it is the basis of the technology. It includes the execution environment and common libraries. Applicable for desktop and base application development for all other purposes described below;
- **Java Enterprise Edition (JEE):** the edition focused on the development of corporate applications and the internet;
- **Java Micro Edition (JME):** the edition for the development of applications for mobile and embedded devices;

### About the Development and Execution Kit:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** is a Java application development kit and consists of several parts for the construction. The main ones to be taken into account are: the Java compiler, the execution environment (virtual machine) and the documenter;
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** is the Java execution environment. The independence of Java applications from operating systems is possible because of this environment. Java applications are run by him, regardless of the Operating System in which they are found;

### How Java Work?
TThe development process until the interaction with the user can be divided into 4 stages.

**1º:** The developer creates the program in JAVA language;</br>
**2º:** The developer saves the code with the **.java** extension;</br>
**3º:** Through the command *javac* at the command prompt (made possible by installing the JDK), the file **.java** is compiled, which generates the file **.class** (known as *bytecode*) destined for the virtual machine;</br>
**4º:** When running the program **.class** through the command *java nomedoarquivoclass*, the JVM is invoked to interpret the generated file, and the result of the interpretation is the application being executed;
